# Discord Activities Bot

A slash command bot for opening Discord voice channel activities.

**[Add the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=893159124701941802&permissions=1&scope=bot%20applications.commands)**

After adding the bot, use `/activity`

- Do not worry if the bot status is offline. Sometime it's intentional.
